(Σ > Sigma > (According to one hypothesis,[Jeffery, Lilian H. (1961). The Local Scripts of Archaic] the name "sigma" may continue that of Phoenician samekh (𐤎) > "The Phoenician letter may continue a glyph from the Middle Bronze Age alphabets, either based on a hieroglyph for a tent peg or support, possibly the djed "pillar"")*5


*5 Based on Semitic linguists (hypothesized), Samekh has no surviving descendant in the Arabic alphabet, and that sīn is derived from Phoenician šīn 𐤔 rather than Phonecian sāmek 𐤎, but it corresponds exclusively to Arabic س Sīn when comparing etymologically to other Semitic languages.
Samekh has no surviving descendant in the Arabic alphabet, the Arabic letter shīn was an acronym for "something" 


𐤔𐤐𐤋(Read from left to right)

So when thinking about the relation of *3 > *2 > *1 in a new cultural exanchge.The relations behind the letters are some what interesting in the meaning of(starting small with something).


"So when meeting new cultures begin gradually with something small / build on a pillar."


































wikipedia "Greek Sigma got its shape and alphabetic position from Phoenician Šin (), but its name and sound value from Phoenician Samekh"

So the pillar as a symbol of somthing durable / to build on.

(Sigma Σ = 𐤔)  > Samekh  = pillar.


The Phoenician letter may continue a glyph from the Middle Bronze Age alphabets, either based on a hieroglyph for a tent peg or support, possibly the djed "pillar" 


So when meeting new cultures begin gradually with something small / build on a pillar.
