Something With space.


Like you can define a plane with a simple normal consisting of 3 numbers you can take this approach to higher dimensions and introduce other variables.

Starting with a Line that can be defined by two vectors XY same like a plane XYZ...

When you define a line with X,Y,Z and keep the initial ratio that provides the information of the direction of that line you can scale the third vector z (keeping the ratio) to define the magnitude of that line.

Extending this to the plane with a line on it would lead to a plane X,Y,Z,W,F,H,I,K  where XYZ define the plane W the dimension/magnitude of that plane and FH the line with I as the position/magnitude on the plane and K represents the dot that can travel on a line. You have to preserve the information that is needed to define the orientation you can never reach 0 or 1.



You can unfold this did it like to a prism if I am right.
